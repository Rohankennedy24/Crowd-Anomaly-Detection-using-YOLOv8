#  Crowd Anomaly Detection using YOLOv8

# Overview
This project uses **YOLOv8** (Ultralytics) with **OpenCV** to perform:

Crowd management and safety monitoring are crucial in smart cities, public events, and transportation hubs. This project combines real-time crowd counting with anomaly detection to automatically identify suspicious or unusual objects in crowded pedestrian areas.
By leveraging YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) for object detection and OpenCV for visualization, the system provides a practical solution for crowd analytics, surveillance, and anomaly monitoring.

-  **Crowd Counting** → Detects and counts people in real-time.  
-  **Anomaly Detection** → Identifies unusual objects (e.g., car, truck, bus, fire hydrant, airplane, boat) in pedestrian areas.  
-   Works on video input (`street_walk.mp4` or your own).
