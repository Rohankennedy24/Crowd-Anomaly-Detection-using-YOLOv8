#  Crowd Anomaly Detection using YOLOv8

This project uses **YOLOv8** (Ultralytics) with **OpenCV** to perform:

-  **Crowd Counting** → Detects and counts people in real-time.  
-  **Anomaly Detection** → Identifies unusual objects (e.g., car, truck, bus, fire hydrant, airplane, boat) in pedestrian areas.  
-   Works on video input (`street_walk.mp4` or your own).
